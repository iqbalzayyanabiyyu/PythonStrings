# STRINGS
# A string is a sequence of characters. You can access the characters one at a time with the bracket operator.
# If you want to use text in python, you can to use a string
# example :
print("Hello Iqbal")

# Backslash
# Some characters can't be directly included in a string. For instance, double quotes can't be directly included in a double quote string; this would cause it to end prematurely.
# Characters like these must be escaped by placing a backslash before them.
# Double quotes only need to be escaped in double quote strings, and the same is true for single quote strings.

# example :
print("Budi\'s mother: He\'s not an angel.")

# Newlines
# You can to use \n for newlines
# example :
print("Hello, \nGood Morning")

# you can also to use three quotes
# example :
print("""Hello,
Good Morning
Everyone""")

# Concatenation
# As with integers and floats, strings in Python can be added, using a process called concatenation, which can be done on any two strings.
